# Fake-Audio-Detection

## SW중심대학 디지털 경진대회_SW와 생성AI의 만남 : AI 부문
## 주제: 생성 AI의 가짜(Fake) 음성 검출 및 탐지

This repository contains the code for the solution submitted to the SW-centered University Digital Innovation Contest: The Intersection of Software and Generative AI — AI Track. The competition focused on detecting and identifying fake audio generated by generative AI models.

### Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and classify fake audio samples generated by AI models. Multiple methods and preprocessing techniques were tested to achieve the highest possible detection performance.

### Methods Used

MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
A simple yet effective neural network approach for audio classification.

Res2Net
A deeper model designed to capture more complex features in the audio data.

SpecRNet
A specialized model focused on spectral features for improved audio analysis.

### Preprocessing Techniques

Speaker Count
Used to extract speaker-related features for classification.

Denoising
Applied to remove background noise and improve the quality of the audio for better analysis.

Noise Suppression
Implemented to suppress unwanted noise and enhance the clarity of the audio.

Speech Separation
Applied to separate mixed speech signals into individual channels to enhance detection accuracy.

Audio Merge (Data Augmentation)
Merged multiple audio samples to create a more diverse training set and improve model robustness.

Best Performing Model
The best performance was achieved using a combination of Denoising and MLP. This method showed the most promising results in detecting fake audio samples.
